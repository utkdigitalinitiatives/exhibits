        <h2>The Studienbuch</h2>
        <p>At the heart of this exhibit is a unique bound volume of a groundbreaking publication in music pedagogy, Gottfried Galston's <span className="studybook">Studienbuch</span>. The exhibit features the first edition of the Austrian-born pianist's German-language book (1910), accompanied by a specially-commissioned, and previously unpublished, English translation. The bound volume includes several editorial changes, handwritten by Galston, and later incorporated into the book's second edition, which was published in the 1920s in five separate sections.</p>
        
        <p>In this pioneering studybook, Galston provides a thorough record of his thought processes and musical interpretations for the works of five composers - Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, and Brahms. Widely used in German-speaking countries, the studybook is made available here for the first time with an English translation, and with the hope that it may contribute to music pedagogy in the U.S. and beyond.</p>

                    publisher and gallery owner in Berlin. Cassirer's catalog was primarily art books, Galston's music
                    study book being somewhat of an exception. The two men may have known each other through mutual

        <h2>Gottfried Galston</h2>
        <p>A preeminent concert pianist of the early twentieth century, Gottfried Galston (1879-1950) studied with leading pedagogues in Austria and Germany before embarking on a career distinguished not only by his virtuosic performances but also by an innovative and insightful approach to piano pedagogy. His remarkable series of concert performances enthralled audiences around the world and were highly acclaimed by critics with the highest of praise: "[H]is superb playing [...] has been thoroughly artistic, without even being dry or pedantic, exquisite in tone, and well nigh perfect in technique." (<span className="studybook">Daily Telegraph</span>, London, February 22, 1907) Galston's Studienbuch received an equally acclamatory response: "Galston's tremendous intellectual and musical grasp is evidenced throughout his book" (<span className="studybook">Musical Courier</span>, July 3, 1912)</p>

        <p>Galston taught at several notable institutions in Germany and toured extensively internationally, performing in Europe, Australasia, and the United States, where he later settled and taught at the St. Louis Institute of Music. More about Galston's life and career, and the significance of his <span className="studybook">Studienbuch</span> in music pedagogy can be found in this exhibit.</p>

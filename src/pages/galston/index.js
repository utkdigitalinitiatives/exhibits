        <h2>The Studienbuch</h2>
        <p>At the heart of this exhibit is a unique, bound volume of a groundbreaking publication in music pedagogy - <Link to="/galston/studienbuch" activeClassName="active">Gottfried Galston’s <span className="studybook">Studienbuch</span></Link>. The exhibit features the first edition of the Austrian-born pianist’s German-language book (1910), accompanied by a specially-commissioned--and previously unpublished--English translation. The bound volume includes several editorial changes -- handwritten by Galston -- later incorporated into the book's 2nd edition (1922).</p>
        <p>In this pioneering studybook, Galston provides a thorough record of his thought processes and musical interpretations for the works of five composers - Bach, Beethoven, Liszt, Brahms, and Chopin. Widely used in German-speaking countries, the studybook is made available here for the first time with an English translation and the hope that it may contribute to music pedagogy in the U.S. and beyond.</p>

                    Extra illustrated copy is a bookbinding term that refers to a book which has been rebound with

                    case it is believed the intention was for Galston to provide editorial changes for the second
                    edition of the Studienbuch."</p>

        <h2>Gottfried Galston</h2>
        <p>A preeminent concert pianist of the early twentieth century,  <Link to="/galston/gottfried-galston" activeClassName="active">Gottfried Galston (1879-1950)</Link> studied with leading pedagogues in Austria and Germany before embarking on a career distinguished not only by his virtuosic performances, but also by an innovative and insightful approach to piano pedagogy. His remarkable series of concert performances enthralled audiences around the world and were highly acclaimed by critics with the highest of praise, "[...] his superb playing [...] has been thoroughly artistic, without even being dry or pedantic, exquitite in tone, and well nigh perfect in technique." (Daily Telegraph, London, February 22, 1907) Galston's Studienbuch received an equally acclamatory response, "Galston's tremendous intellectual and musical grasp is evidenced this book [...]" (Musical Courier, July 3, 1912)</p>
        <p>Galston taught at several notable institutions in Germany and toured extensively internationally, performing in Europe, Australasia, and the United States, where he later settled and taught at the St. Louis Institute of Music. More about Galston's life and career, and the signicance of his Studienbuch in music pedagogy can be found in this exhibit.</p>
